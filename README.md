# TODO app in Elm

This is forked from https://github.com/evancz/elm-todomvlc, but my intention is
to grow this into a more useful application, not a demo.

## Goals

- Entries should be organized by day.
- When opened for the first time the user should be asked whether they want to
  import incomplete entries from the previous day.
- Should be able to add entries for future days.
- Should be able to create recurring entries.

## Build Instructions

Run the following command from the root of this project:

```bash
make
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser!
